# Quick read (60 seconds)

These case studies show how **the examiner** approaches an investigation end-to-end using a structured, evidence-driven workflow.

## What the reader will see
- Preserves integrity (hashing; repeatable steps)
- Collects high-value artifacts quickly (triage acquisition)
- Reconstructs user/system activity from Windows artifacts (registry, execution traces, logs)
- Correlates evidence into a defensible timeline
- Validates hypotheses using facts (not conjecture)
- Communicates clearly in a structured report format

## Best entry points

- **Memory Analysis (25-T108)** — Volatility 3 workflow + process/network triage
- **Threat Hunting (25-T110)** — endpoint hunting + evidence-backed reasoning
