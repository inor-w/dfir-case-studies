These case studies show how **the examiner** approaches an investigation end-to-end:

- Preserves integrity (hashing; repeatable steps)
- Collects high-value artifacts quickly (triage acquisition)
- Reconstructs user/system activity from Windows artifacts (registry, execution traces, logs)
- Correlates evidence into a defensible timeline
- Validates hypotheses using facts (not conjecture)
- Communicates clearly in a structured report format

## Best entry points
If time is limited, start with:
- **Capstone (25-T112)** — end-to-end investigation with memory + disk analysis
- **Memory Analysis (25-T108)** — Volatility 3 workflow + process/network triage
- **Threat Hunting (25-T110)** — endpoint hunting + evidence-backed reasoning

## What this repo is (and isn’t)
- ✅ Demonstrates DFIR workflow, tooling familiarity, and professional reporting
- ✅ Emphasizes defensible, evidence-backed conclusions
- ❌ Not a malware-development repository
- ❌ Does not include evidence images or raw datasets
